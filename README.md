Github repository for hardware and software interfacing used in the Hussein Ultrafast Plasma Science group at the University of Alberta.

Currently three projects are in active development

# Viron Laser System

Development of communication protocal to control the Quantel Viron Laser System for Portable LIBS.

-- Developed by Liam Droog and Shubho Mohajan 

# LIBS

Controls for automated laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) experiments. Communication between Stanford trigger box, Stellarnet and Thorlabs spectrometers, and linear translation stages.

-- Developed by Shubho Mohajan and Ying Wan

# Newport XPS

Development of linear translation stations controlled by the Newport XPS D4 system.

-- Developed by Nick Beier

# pyFROG  

Development of ultrafast pulse measurement Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) diagnostic for use with the Spitfire laser system. Currently the software controls the Newport XPS and a Thorlabs CCS200 spectrometer

-- Developed by Nick Beier

# Solid Target Stage

Development of multi-axis target stage for hard X-ray generation with the Spitfire laser system.

-- Developed by Christina Strilets

# DAQ

Development of real-time data acquisition and analysis scripts. Currently fielded at the ALLS facility in Quebec. Watchdog scripts are used to pull data from remote desktops before being combined into a single file system.

--Developed by Nick Beier

# Tektronix TBS2000B Oscilloscope
Communication with a TBS2000B oscilloscope to read out nanosecond pulse pulse shape and energy information from a photodiode during experiments
